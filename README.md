# flasktrack

This is a companion server to [the PhoneTrack app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.eneiluj.nextcloud.phonetrack/).
It exposes an endpoint that clients can send location info to on a continuous basis, and provides a simple web client that renders the location data over time.

For an example of how this app is deployed, see my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/stupidcomputer/dot_testing/blob/cc905bbce7695b54c81c5c9922f743f6f769bb6c/boxes/netbox/flasktrack.nix).
